Working animezone apk without certificate pinning

To change update url/simkl you need to decompile and edit lib/*version*/libapp.so with an hex editor. Note that it will not work without the release structure seen here.


**NOTE: Funimation or spyderbibek if you want this taken down open an issue and I'll take it down immediately, half of the fun was trying to crack this.**
